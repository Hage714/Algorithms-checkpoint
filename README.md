Overview:
This program reads a sentence character by character, where each sentence ends with a period ('.'). The purpose is to demonstrate a simple algorithm for reading and processing text input one character at a time.

How to Use:
- Run the program.
- Input a sentence ending with a period ('.').
- The program will read the sentence character by character and display each character as it's read.
- The program will terminate after processing the entire sentence.


Overview:
This JavaScript program implements the Insertion Sort algorithm. Unlike the traditional insertion sort, this implementation only considers the first i-1 elements of the array during each iteration. It picks the element arr[i] and inserts it into the sorted sequence in the array from index 0 to i-1.

How to Use:
- Include the insertionSort function in your JavaScript project.
- Call the insertionSort function, passing an array as an argument.
- The function will sort the array in ascending order using the modified insertion sort algorithm.
